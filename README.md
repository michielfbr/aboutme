# :raising_hand: Hey!

## :handshake:My name is Michiel

Recently I made the definitive decision to shift my carreer from live experiences to online experiences.
The lack of live events recently gave me the perfect oppurtunity to attend [Codaisseur](https://codaisseur.com/)s fullstack development bootcamp, and deepdive into the programming world.
Freshly graduated now I am now ready to kick of the carreer!

## :framed_picture:My projects

### MyRecipeBook

A place to store and browse through the recipes you collect.

At Codiasseur I built this full-stack web app for my portfolio. And I'm actually using it for myself!
The frontend uses JavaScript, React, Redux, CSS React-bootstrap & additional libraries.
The backend uses Express, JWT, Bcrypt, a PostgreSQL database with Sequelize ORM.
