### Hi! :raising_hand:

My name is Michiel.

After an amazing carreer as a live sound engineer, I made the definitive decision to shift my carreer from live experiences to online experiences.
The lack of live events during covid gave me the perfect oppurtunity to attend [Codaisseur Academy](https://codaisseur.com/)'s fullstack development bootcamp, deepdiving into the programming world.

Currently I spend my profesional time working on the backend side of Elixir Phoenix applications at [Valk Digital](https://www.valkdigital.nl/), the digital service provider for [Valk Exclusief](https://www.valkexclusief.nl/). Feel welcome to drop by, have dinner and spend the night!*

\*  _At one of the hotels offcourse**, not with me._   
\** _At your own expense._
